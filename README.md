# Steam Works
**Steam Works** is a [Factorio](https://factorio.com) mod adding a collection of additinal uses for steam.
While currently small i am happy to implement more stuff if you have an idea.

## Steam-Steam Heat Exchange
A single unit of 500째 steam contains 97 kJ. A single unit of 165째C steam contains 30 kJ.
The steam-steam heat exchange produces 95 units of 165째C steam for every 30 units of 500째C steam consumed. The 2 units of steam missing from a perfect ratio correspond to a total loss of 2.06%.

The steam-steam heat exchange can be used to produce cool *steam barrels* from a nuclear reactor, but also for [coal liquefaction](https://wiki.factorio.com/index.php?title=Coal_liquefaction).
